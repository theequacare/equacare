                <h3>Understanding Non-Medical Home Care</h3>
                <p>Non-medical home care focuses on helping with daily activities like bathing, dressing, meal preparation, and companionship. Unlike medical care, it doesn't involve treatments or proceduresâ€”just compassionate support to help you live independently at home.</p>
