## üìÅ Where Images Are Stored

All uploaded images are saved to:
- **Location**: `/Users/equacare/Documents/equacare/media/homepage/`
- **URL**: Automatically handled by Django

---

## üîÑ Fallback Content

If you haven't created Hero or About Preview sections in admin yet, the website will automatically show:
- Static images from `/static/images/`
- Default text content

This means your site will always work, even without admin content!
